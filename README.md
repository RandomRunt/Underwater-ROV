# Underwater ROV and Controller
The formal report is in PDF form in the root directory of this repo. I was responsible mainly for the CAD of the ROV, design of the ROV electronics, design of the controller, CAD of the controller and coding of the controller. 

# Project Summary
## Problem Statement
Microplastics pose a major threat to marine wildlife in the modern day due to their slow decomposition and adverse effects to aquatic life. To combat this, the NSW government requires the construction of a lithium battery powered underwater ROV capable of removing and storing plastic waste in an aquatic environment. It is tethered by cable to one side of the pool and is controlled manually whilst collecting rings and navigating in a 9m stretch of pool - representing its ability to collect and store microplastic waste. The ROV must perform the ring collection within the 5 minute time limit while keeping onboard cargo dry. Constraints of the ROV include a weight limitation of 5kg, a cost limitation of $150 and a max size of 300mm x 300mm x 300mm.
